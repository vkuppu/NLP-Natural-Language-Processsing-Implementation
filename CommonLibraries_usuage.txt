Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. 
Using this library, we can search for the values of html tags and get specific data like title of the page and the list of headers in the page.
Install Beautifulsoup
Use the Anaconda package manager to install the required package and its dependent packages.
conda install Beaustifulsoap
We first have to import the library, and create an instance of the BeautifulSoup class to parse our document:
Then use the html parser parameter to read the entire html file. 
---------
>>from bs4
>>import BeautifulSoup
>>soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser')
--------
Requests 
The requests library will make a GET request to a web server, which will download the HTML contents of a given web page for us. There are several different types of requests we can make using requests.
One of the most common HTTP methods is GET. The GET method indicates that you’re trying to get or retrieve data from a specified resource. To make a GET request, invoke requests.get().
Other popular HTTP methods include POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, PATCH, and OPTIONS.

urllib
urllib is a Python module that can be used for opening URLs. It defines functions and classes to help in URL actions.
>>urlopen

This function is capable of fetching URLs using a variety of different protocols
(HTTP, FTP, ...)   Just pass the URL to urlopen() to get a "file-like" handle to the remote data.

Additionaly, urllib2 offers an interface for handling common situations -like basic authentication, cookies, proxies and so on. These are provided by objects called handlers and openers.
