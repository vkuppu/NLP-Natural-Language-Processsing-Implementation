To understand this project let's have brief introduction of NLP

What is Natural Language Processing?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers to understand, interpret and manipulate human language.
NLP helps developers to organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks like translation, summarization, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, speech recognition, topic segmentation, etc.
NLP is used to analyze text, allowing machines to understand how human’s speak. This human-computer interaction enables real-world applications like automatic text summarization, sentiment analysis, topic extraction, named entity recognition, parts-of-speech tagging, relationship extraction, stemming, and more. NLP is commonly used for text mining, machine translation, and automated question answering.
What are the benefits of learning NLP?
As all of you know, millions of gigabytes every day are generated by blogs, social websites, and web pages.
There are many companies gathering all of this data to better understand users and their passions and make appropriate changes.
These data could show that the people of Brazil are happy with product A, while the people of the US are happier with product B. With NLP, this knowledge can be found instantly (i.e. a real-time result). For example, search engines are a type of NLP that give the appropriate results to the right people at the right time.
But search engines are not the only implementation of natural language processing (NLP). There are a lot of even more awesome implementations out there.
NLP Libraries
There are many open source Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries. These are some of them:
•	Natural language toolkit (NLTK)
•	Apache OpenNLP
•	Stanford NLP suite
•	Gate NLP library
Natural language toolkit (NLTK) is the most popular library for natural language processing (NLP). It was written in Python and has a big community behind it.
NLTK also is very easy to learn, actually, it's the easiest natural language processing (NLP) library that you'll use.
Components of NLP
Five main Component of Natural Language processing are:
•	Morphological and Lexical Analysis
•	Syntactic Analysis
•	Semantic Analysis
•	Discourse Integration
•	Pragmatic Analysis
