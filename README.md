# NLP-Natural-Language-Processsing-Implementation

-NLP implemenatation using python 

-jypter notebook is used for coding throughout the implementation

-searching for the dataset , yet to finalise the dataset .

-initial phase for creating a framwork with sample text or group of paragraphs

-Later after finalising the dataset ,i will upload the dataset as well.

Let's have small introduction About NLP 



What is Natural Language Processing?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers to understand, interpret and manipulate human language.
NLP helps developers to organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks like translation, summarization, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, speech recognition, topic segmentation, etc.
NLP is used to analyze text, allowing machines to understand how human’s speak. This human-computer interaction enables real-world applications like automatic text summarization, sentiment analysis, topic extraction, named entity recognition, parts-of-speech tagging, relationship extraction, stemming, and more. NLP is commonly used for text mining, machine translation, and automated question answering.
Components of NLPa. Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
Natural Language Understanding revolves around machine reading comprehension. This is an AI-hard problem. An NLU system needs the following components-
•	Lexicon, Parser, and Grammar rules.
•	Semantic theory- to guide comprehension.
b. Natural Language Generation (NLG)
NLG is concerned with generating natural language. It uses a machine representation system like a knowledge base or a logical form. You can think of it as a translator between data and natural language representation; this is the opposite or NLU. This involves three tasks-
•	Text Planning- To extract relevant content from the knowledge base.
•	Sentence Planning- To choose appropriate words, form meaningful phrases, and set sentence tone.
•	Text Realization- To map the sentence plan into sentence structure.
